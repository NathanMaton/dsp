[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*From the instructions: Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following markdown files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)*

*Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*

##  Answer  

>>The question for this assignment is about randomness and specifically randomness created by np.random.random. Are they truly random? We're asked to look into this by ploting their PMF and CDF.  

>>Using the PMF and CDF I've looked at this question. The CDF graph below should be completely linear if the random function was truly random. You can see the distribution isn't linear therefore the random function isn't truly random.
